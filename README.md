This project was based mainly on segmenting customers into clusters, analysing the cluster, and making analysis-backed business recommendations <br>
Clustering is a powerful, undirected data mining technique used in business analytics for identifying hidden patterns and structures in a vast volume of data without formulating a specific hypothesis. It has a wide range of applications and can effectively deal with a variety of issues and goals, from the smallest to the most complicated. There are several popular clustering types for each application, but we will place a focus primarily on client clustering for the purpose of this project. <p>  

**What then is Client Clustering?** <br>
Client clustering is a method of organizing individuals based on their behavior, routines, preferences, values, socioeconomic class, location, and demographics, among other factors. With Clustering, organizations optimize the quality of the messages they convey to the general public, such as product promotions with greater purchasing potential or an after-sales service tailored to the customerâ€™s prior purchase. This strengthens consumer relationships, which consequently raises sales. <br>
### Steps I took in carrying out the project <br>
1. Imported Data
2. Cleaning and Preparation
3. Hypothesis Formulation
4. Clustering and Visualization
5. Visualization and Analysis
6. General Deductions and Propositions
